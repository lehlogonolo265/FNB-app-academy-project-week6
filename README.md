# Week 6 ‚Äì FNB App Academy

## üì± Project Overview: Contact Book App

In Week 6, we developed a dynamic **Contact Book App** that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete contact entries. This project introduced the concept of **APIs** and **JSON data**, and demonstrated how to interact with an external database using `fetch()` in JavaScript.

This app uses:
- **HTML & CSS** for layout and styling
- **JavaScript** for functionality
- **REST API** to manage and store contacts
